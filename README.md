## Usage of Linux Commands

This section covers various Linux commands, their usage, and practical examples. From basic file management to more advanced networking and process-related commands, you'll find useful explanations and code snippets.

## Shell Programming

Learn the art of shell scripting! Shell programming is an essential skill for automating tasks and performing system administration. Dive into this section to explore scripting techniques, loops, conditionals, and more.

## C Program to Implement Linux Commands

In this section, we provide C programs that implement some of the commonly used Linux commands. Understanding these implementations will deepen your knowledge of operating system interactions.

## Child Process Creation and Termination

Learn how to create and manage child processes in an operating system. This section explores process creation, communication, and termination.

## CPU Scheduling Algorithms

Study various CPU scheduling algorithms used by operating systems to allocate CPU time to processes. This section covers FCFS, SJF, Priority Scheduling, and Round-Robin Scheduling.

## Zombie and Orphan Processes

Explore the concepts of zombie and orphan processes in an operating system and learn how to handle them effectively.

## Bankers Algorithm

Understand the Banker's algorithm, which is used for deadlock avoidance in resource allocation scenarios.

## Page Replacement Algorithms

Learn about page replacement algorithms used in virtual memory management to optimize memory usage.

## Memory Allocation Algorithms

Study memory allocation algorithms, including best-fit, worst-fit, and first-fit, to efficiently manage memory allocation in an operating system.

## Thread Creation and Termination

Learn about thread creation, management, and termination in an operating system environment. Threads are essential for parallel execution and concurrent programming.

## Semaphores and Monitors

Dive into the world of synchronization mechanisms using semaphores and monitors. We'll solve classic synchronization problems like the Dining Philosophers Problem and the Producer-Consumer Problem.
